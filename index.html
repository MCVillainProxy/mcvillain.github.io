      <p>Chairman of the board, John McQuillan has called an emergency board meeting for this Wednesday at his attorney's office in Cambridge. He plans on formally dissolving the board to establish an executive group that sides with his opinions and plans for the school.</p>

      <p>From what I understand, 18 out of the 30 current trustees are not on board w the Chair's plans nor do they agree with how he's conducting himself.  This is why Mr. McQuillan is seeking to dissolve the board.</p>

      <p>McQuillan's plans for the school include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Coeducation</li>
        <li>Drastic reduction in enrollment</li>
        <li>Significant increase in tuition</li>
        <li>"Market to the 1%"</li>
        <li>Stripping of religious affiliation</li>
        <li>Selling the land and relocating the school downtown</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Mr. McQuillan and those that stand with him are using the polarizing coed debate as a smoke screen to pass their other initiatives. As many of you know, he is leaking false information to the Globe to bolster his case.</p>

      <p>If his plan comes to fruition, BC High will only continue to exist in name. The identity of the school will be forever lost.</p>

      <p>Regardless of where you stand on the coed issue, I urge you to reach out to the board and let them know that the manner in which decisions are being made is completely unacceptable.  Many of you have seen my open letter expressing a vote of no confidence and asking that John McQuillan be removed as chair that was sent last week. If you share some or all of my opinions, I encourage you to make your voice known.</p>

      <p>Every board member and trustee associate are included in Chris Taylor's email below.</p>

      <p>Please pass this to friends, classmates, parents etc. who may be interested.</p>

      <div class="source">

      <p>Greg</p>

      <p>I am sending this email on behalf of the BC High Associates. </p>

      <p>Over the past few months, many of us have received a host of emails, read Boston Globe articles, and heard rumors suggesting that big changes would be coming to BC High. Much of this has focused on the possibility of going co-ed. </p>

      <p>While the school considers that transition alongside other important issues, all of which are worthy of transparent and vigorous debate, they are in no way the focus of our concern. </p>

      <p>Rather, we write this letter to join fellow alumni in calling for the resignation or removal of John McQuillan from the board of trustees.</p>

      <p>Our concern stems from rumors about board chairman McQuillan's tactics and personal incentives to steer BC High in a direction antithetical to the school's values and mission. </p>

      <p>As you know, John McQuillan has excluded the majority of those traditionally involved in various trustee-related capacities from recent deliberations, the most important of which will take place today at his attorney's offices.</p>

      <p>We are the first to say that we don't have all of the facts, and the last thing we want to do is spread unverified rumors. </p>

      <p>That said, in the absence of facts and without being afforded the opportunity to participate in the ongoing discussions, many alumni have begun trying to connect the dots on their own, and the hypotheses we'e heard gravely concern us. As we all know, transparency and trust in carrying out the school's mission are imperative.</p>

      <p>From discussions with numerous trustees, alumni, and others, there is a growing belief that John McQuillan hopes to make several fundamental changes to B.C. High's governance structures, mission, and values. </p>


<b>
      <p>Our understanding of these objectives is as follows:</p>

      <p>This afternoon, at his attorney's offices, John McQuillan seeks to fundamentally alter the composition of the board by essentially dissolving the Board of Trustees, Trustee Associates, and BC High Associates and to replace these groups with a small contingent of approximately 10 trustees, all appointed by him.</p>

      <p>With the hand-selected group of approximately 10 trustees, he seeks to push through the following agenda:</p>

      <p>Turn BC High into a co-ed school.
      Bring an end to the school's Jesuit affiliation.
      Focus exclusively on attracting students from high net worth families.
      Move the school from Morrissey Boulevard to a new location.</p>
</b>


      <p>As discussed more fully below, we have tried but, thus far, been unable to confirm some of the potential changes listed above. </p>

      <p>We do, however, believe it's important to recognize that the current discussions in the BC High community have ignited now rampant concern and speculation. </p>

      <p>We are not advocating for any specific strategic decisions or policies. </p>

      <p>We are, however, advocating for integrity, inclusion, transparency, and trust. Until proven otherwise, we will give John's integrity the full benefit of the doubt. </p>

      <p>However, we still lack inclusion, transparency, and trust. Decisions that will change the school's identity are being made behind closed doors.</p> 

      <p>The majority of us have been shut out of the decision making process, and President Kemeza is, respectfully, a lame duck. </p>

      <p>With that, we no longer have a system of appropriate checks and balances, and the chairman's motivations are being questioned by a growing number within the community.</p>

      <p>John's tactics and these rumors have led to an erosion of trust in John as a leader of this school, and they are leading to an erosion of trust in BC High as an institution.</p>

      <p>Last night, a group of BC High Associates made its way to the school and waited patiently outside of a meeting between certain members of the board and the BC High faculty. </p>

      <p><b>We intended to ask John McQuillan about the alleged changes he wanted to make to the school and his motivations for those changes. After emerging from the meeting at approximately 8:30 p.m., John McQuillan refused to engage us in discussion, suggesting that we email him to set up a meeting before leaving the school in a hurry.</b></p>

      <p>We understand that there will be important decisions regarding the school's future in the months and years ahead, and we believe such decisions must be anchored trust. We have lost our trust.</p>

      <p>For that reason, we ask members of the board of trustees to act upon Article III, Header A, Section 4 of the attached Trustee by-laws to remove John from his role on the board of Trustees, effective immediately.</p>

      <p>We believe it is critical that such action is taken immediately, prior to today's meeting of John and his executive committee. The referenced section reads:</p>

      <p>Removal of a Trustee from office may be effected by a majority vote of the entire Board without assigning cause therefore, when such action is, in the judgment of the majority of the said Board, to be in the best interests of the Corporation.</p>

      <p>I believe I speak for all alumni in saying that we thank the Board of Trustees for their continued integrity and leadership in this tumultuous time. </p>

      <p>We look forward to the vigorous and transparent debates around the future of BC High, but we refuse to stand aside while the acting leadership fails to uphold the values of our alma mater.</p>
